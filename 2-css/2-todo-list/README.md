# Stylized To-Do List

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing to-do list that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your HTML file should contain an unordered list with the class `todo-list`.
2. The unordered list should have four list items.
3. Each list item should contain:
   - An `input` element with the type `checkbox` and a unique `id`.
   - A `label` element with the `for` attribute set to the corresponding input element's `id`.
   - An unordered list with the class `sub-item`.
   - A list item inside the `sub-item` list containing an anchor (`a`) element.
4. The anchor element should:
   - Have the class `sub-item-link`.
   - Contain a valid `href` value.
   - Have a `target` attribute with the value `_blank` to open in a new tab.
5. You should remove the default list style from `.todo-list`.
6. Anchor elements should not have any default text decoration.
7. The text color of links should be a color of your choice.
8. When the links are visited, they should change to another color of your choice.
9. When hovered over, the links should change to another color of your choice.
10. When focused, the links should have a colored outline around them.
11. When clicked, the links should change to another color of your choice.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the to-do list.
2. Ensure your `styles.css` file is linked correctly in the `head` section of your HTML.
3. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to verify that all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Add your own personal style while maintaining the required functionality.
- Ensure all links point to valid destinations.
- Use proper semantic HTML for better accessibility.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique stylized to-do list.

# Build an Event Flyer Page

## Description

This project is part of a front-end development lab where you'll practice structuring and styling a webpage by creating an event flyer. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing flyer that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your HTML file should contain a `header` element within the `body`.
2. The `header` element should include:
   - An `img` element as the first child for your event image.
   - An `h1` element as the second child containing your event title.
3. Your `body` should contain a `main` element.
4. Inside the `main` element, there should be at least two `section` elements showcasing event features.
5. Each `section` element should contain an `h2` element.
6. Your `h2` elements should have text describing the event features.
7. Your `body` element should have:
   - A top and bottom padding of `50px`.
   - A top and bottom margin of `0`.
   - A left and right margin that centers itself.
   - A width set relative to the viewport width using `vw`.
   - A `min-height` set using `calc(100vh - 100px)`.
8. Your flyer should include at least one `hr` element.
9. The `width` of all `hr` and `section` elements should be set as a percentage of their parent.

## Styling Requirements

- Ensure your `styles.css` file is linked properly in your `HTML`.
- Apply styles to create an aesthetically pleasing event flyer.
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility and structure.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the event flyer.
2. Ensure your `styles.css` file is linked correctly in the `head` section of your HTML.
3. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to verify that all requirements are met.

## Example Project

# Blog Post Card

## Description

This project is part of a front-end development lab where you'll practice styling backgrounds and borders by creating a blog post card. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing blog post card that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your HTML file should contain a `div` with the class `blog-post-card` to hold all elements of the blog post card.
2. Within the `.blog-post-card` div, include an `img` element with:
   - A valid `alt` attribute and text.
   - A class of `post-img`.
   - A `src` attribute set to `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/cover-photo.jpg`.
3. Include a `div` with the class `post-content` inside `.blog-post-card`, which should contain:
   - An `h2` element with the class `post-title` and text for the blog post title.
   - A `p` element with the class `post-excerpt` and text summarizing the blog post.
   - An `a` element with the class `read-more` and the text `Read More`.

  - A white background.

  - Rounded corners.
  - A `display` property set to `inline-block`.
  - A hover effect that changes its background color.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the blog post card.
2. Ensure your `styles.css` file is linked correctly in the `head` section of your HTML.
3. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to verify that all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Add your own personal style while maintaining the required functionality.
- Use proper semantic HTML for better accessibility.
- Ensure all elements are properly styled to create a visually appealing design.

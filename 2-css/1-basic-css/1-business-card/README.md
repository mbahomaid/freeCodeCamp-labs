# Design a Business Card

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing business card that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your HTML file should link to a `styles.css` file using the `link` tag in the `head` section.
2. The page background should be `rosybrown`, and the overall font should be `Arial` with a fallback to `sans-serif`.
3. All `p` elements should have a top and bottom margin of `5px`.
4. By default, all links should not be underlined. When hovered over, they should be underlined.
5. There should be a `div` with the class `business-card`.
6. The `.business-card` class should:
   - Be `300px` wide.
   - Have a background color of your choice.
   - Have `20px` padding all around.
   - Have a top margin of `100px`.
   - Center-align the text.
   - Have a font size of `16px`.
   - Have left and right margins set to `auto`.
7. Inside the `.business-card` div:
   - There should be an `img` element with the class `profile-image`.
   - The image source should be set to `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/flower.jpg` (optional).
   - The `alt` attribute should contain a meaningful description.
8. After the `img` element:
   - There should be three `p` elements with the classes `full-name`, `designation`, and `company`, respectively.
   - The first `p` should contain your name.
   - The second `p` should contain your designation.
   - The third `p` should contain your company name.
9. There should be an `hr` element below the `p` element containing the company name.
10. After the `hr` element:
    - There should be two `p` elements, one containing an email address and another containing a phone number.
    - There should be an `a` element with the text **Portfolio**, linking to a valid website.
    - After the `a` element, there should be another `hr` element.
11. There should be another `div` with the class `social-media`.
12. Inside the `.social-media` div:
    - There should be an `h2` element with the text **Connect with me**.
    - There should be three `a` elements with the text **Twitter**, **LinkedIn**, and **GitHub**, each linking to a valid URL.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the business card.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to verify that all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Add your own personal style while maintaining the required functionality.
- Ensure all links point to valid destinations.
- Use appropriate `alt` text for the image to improve accessibility.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique business card.

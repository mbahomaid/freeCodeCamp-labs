# Build a Recipe Page

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a simple recipe page that meets the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your recipe page should have a `!DOCTYPE html` declaration.
2. You should have an `html` element with `lang` set to `en`.
3. You should have a `head` element containing:
   - A `title` element with the name of your recipe.
   - A `meta` element with a `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
4. You should have a `body` element.
5. Your page should include:
   - An `h1` element with the name of your recipe.
   - A `p` element below the `h1` that introduces the recipe.
   - An `h2` element with the text `Ingredients`.
   - An unordered list (`ul`) with at least four list items (`li`) for ingredients.
   - A second `h2` element with the text `Instructions`.
   - An ordered list (`ol`) with at least four list items (`li`) for the instructions.
   - One `img` element with a `src` attribute set to a valid image (e.g., `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/recipe.jpg`) and an `alt` attribute describing the image.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the recipe page.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to ensure all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Try to add your own personal style while keeping the functionality intact.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique recipe page.

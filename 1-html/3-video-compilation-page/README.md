# Build a Video Compilation Page

## Description

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The objective is to build a simple video compilation page that meets the specified user stories and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique while maintaining the required structure and functionality.

## User Stories

1. Your page should have a `main` element as the only child of the `body` element.
2. Inside the `main` element, you should have an `h1` element with the topic of your page.
3. Below the `h1` element, include a `p` element introducing the topic of your page.
4. Your page should contain three `section` elements below the first `p` element.
5. Each `section` element should have the following structure:
   - An `h2` element serving as the title for that section.
   - A `p` element introducing the video content.
   - An `iframe` element for embedding a video.
6. Each `iframe` element should have:
   - A `src` attribute set to a valid video.
   - A `title` attribute describing the embedded content.
   - A `height` and `width` attribute to ensure proper sizing.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the video compilation page.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to ensure all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Ensure that all embedded videos are appropriate and relevant to the pageâ€™s topic.
- The `iframe` elements should be correctly sized for an optimal viewing experience.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Use it as inspiration to create your own unique video compilation page.

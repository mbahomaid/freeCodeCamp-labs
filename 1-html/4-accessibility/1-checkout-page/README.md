# Build a Checkout Page

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing checkout page that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your checkout page should have an `h1` element with the text **Checkout**.
2. Your page should have only one `h1` element.
3. There should be at least two `section` elements immediately after the `h1` element.
4. The first `section` should contain an `h2` element with the text **Your Cart**.
5. The first `section` should include an image of an item with appropriate alternate text.
   - You can use this image if you like: `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/cube.jpg`.
6. The second `section` should contain an `h2` element with the text **Payment Information**.
7. The second `section` should include a `form` element.
8. Within the `form`, there should be an input field for the cardholder's name:
   - `id` of `card-name`
   - `name` of `card-name`
   - A corresponding `label`.
9. Within the `form`, there should be an input field for the card number:
   - `id` of `card-number`
   - `name` of `card-number`
   - A corresponding `label`.
10. All input fields (excluding submit types) should have an associated `label` element.
11. At least two input fields should be required and include the `aria-required` attribute set to `true`.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the checkout page.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to verify that all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Add your own personal style while maintaining the required functionality.
- Ensure all input fields have appropriate placeholder text for a better user experience.
- Use proper HTML5 validation for form fields.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique checkout page.

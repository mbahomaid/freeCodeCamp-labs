# Build a Survey Form

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing survey form that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your survey form should have a `!DOCTYPE html` declaration.
2. You should have an `html` element with `lang` set to `en`.
3. You should have a `head` element containing:
   - A `title` element with an appropriate name for the form.
   - A `meta` element with a `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
4. Your form should include:
   - An `h1` element with an `id` of `title`.
   - A `p` element with an `id` of `description`.
   - A `form` element with an `id` of `survey-form`.
   - An input field for name with:
     - `id` of `name`
     - `type` of `text`
     - A required attribute
     - A corresponding `label` with an `id` of `name-label`
   - An input field for email with:
     - `id` of `email`
     - `type` of `email`
     - A required attribute
     - A corresponding `label` with an `id` of `email-label`
   - An input field for a number with:
     - `id` of `number`
     - `type` of `number`
     - `min` and `max` attributes
     - A corresponding `label` with an `id` of `number-label`
   - A `select` dropdown with an `id` of `dropdown` containing at least two options.
   - A set of at least two radio buttons, grouped using the `name` attribute.
   - A set of at least two checkboxes, each with a `value` attribute.
   - A `textarea` element for additional comments.
   - A submit button with an `id` of `submit` and `type` of `submit`.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the survey form.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to ensure all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Try to add your own personal style while keeping the functionality intact.
- Ensure all input fields have appropriate placeholder text for better user experience.
- Use proper HTML5 validation for form fields.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique survey form.

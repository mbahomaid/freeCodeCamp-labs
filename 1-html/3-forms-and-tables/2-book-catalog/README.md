# Build a Book Catalog Table

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a functional and visually appealing book catalog table that meets all the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. You should create a `table` element that lists book information.
2. Your table should have a `thead` element with one row in it.
3. The row in your `thead` element should have four `th` elements, with the text `Title`, `Author`, `Genre`, and `Publication Year`, in that order.
4. Your table should have a `tbody` element with at least five rows in it.
5. Each row in your `tbody` should have four `td` elements that display the book's `Title`, `Author`, `Genre`, and `Publication Year`.
6. Your table should have a `tfoot` element with one row in it.
7. The row in your `tfoot` element should have a `td` element that spans four columns and has the text `Total Books: N` where `N` should be replaced by the number of books in your table.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the book catalog table.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to ensure all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Try to add your own personal style while keeping the functionality intact.
- Ensure all table elements are properly structured for better readability and accessibility.

## Example Project

You can refer to the example project provided by freeCodeCamp, but avoid directly copying it. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique book catalog table.

# Build a Travel Agency Page

## Description

This lab is part of the freeCodeCamp Full Stack curriculum. The goal is to build a simple travel agency page that meets the specified requirements and passes all the provided tests. You are encouraged to add your own personal style to make the project unique.

## User Stories

1. Your travel agency page should have a `!DOCTYPE html` declaration.
2. You should have an `html` element with `lang` set to `en`.
3. You should have a `head` element containing:
   - A `meta` element with a `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
   - A `title` element with the text `Travel Agency Page`.
   - A `meta` element with a `name` attribute set to `description` and a `content` attribute providing a short description of your website for SEO.
4. You should have a `body` element.
5. Your page should include:
   - An `h1` element to present your travel destinations.
   - A `p` element below the `h1` introducing the travel opportunities.
   - An `h2` element with the text `Packages`.
   - A `p` element below the `h2` introducing the various packages.
   - An unordered list (`ul`) with two list items (`li`), each containing an anchor (`a`) element with the text `Group Travels` and `Private Tours`, respectively.
   - An `h2` element with the text `Top Itineraries`.
   - At least three `figure` elements, each containing:
     - An anchor (`a`) element with an `img` element inside it. The `img` should have a valid `src` attribute and an appropriate `alt` attribute.
     - A `figcaption` element with some text describing the image.
6. All anchor (`a`) elements should have an `href` attribute set to `https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn` and a `target` attribute set to `_blank`.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the travel agency page.
2. Use the freeCodeCamp test suite to ensure all requirements are met.

## Notes

- Try to add your own personal style while keeping the functionality intact.
- You can use the following images for your `img` elements if needed:
  - `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/colosseo.jpg`
  - `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/alps.jpg`
  - `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/sea.jpg`
